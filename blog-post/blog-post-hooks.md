# Blog Post Hooks
## Hook 1
SpaceX is sending hundreds of satellites into Earth's orbit to form the biggest satellite constellation in history.We visualized this network and demonstrated how to use a Graph Database for low latency routing.Visit our post and find out more!

## Hook 2
SpaceX is developing Starlink, a low latency internet system in form of a satellite constellation. We have prepared an interactive simulation of their endeavour if you want to find out more about the project.You can look it up on our blog post!

## Hook 3
Learn how Graph Databases can be used for low latency routing in satellite internet constellations like Starlink.Visit our blog post to play around with the graph data yourself or try out our interactive Starlink simulation.

## Hook 4
Real-time optimal routing in large networks can be very resource-consuming and ineffective.Visit our post and find out how an in-memory Graph Database can be used for low latency routing in satellite internet constellations like Starlink.

## Musk Tweet (in progress)
Tried to make a Starlink simulation. What do you think? \[Grinning face emoticon]\[Rocket emoticon]
